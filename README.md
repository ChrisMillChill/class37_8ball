Ask the Magic 8 Ball a question and it will answer! 

How It's Made:
Tech used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js

Currently takes in any text input and with node.js, the website randomly displays a response.

Here's where you can go to town on how you actually built this thing. Write as much as you can here, it's totally fine if it's not too much just make sure you write something. If you don't have too much experience on your resume working on the front end that's totally fine. This is where you can really show off your passion and make up for that ten fold.

Optimizations 
1) Increase quantity of responses.
2) Use machine learning to pick up tones in inputs and chose an appropiate response rather than a random one.

Lessons Learned:
How to integrate node.js into a website and how to use github as a group to compile code.
